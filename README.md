# Dance-Forms

# Overview
This project aims to classify different Indian dance forms using machine learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is designed to predict the Indian dance form from an input image. Through data preprocessing and feature engineering, the dataset was optimized for accurate model training, ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the predictive model.

The predictive model has been deployed as a web application using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to upload images and get predictions.

# Features

* Dance Form Classification: Given an image of an Indian dance form, the model predicts the corresponding dance form.
* Machine Learning Techniques: Uses both ANN and CNN for image classification tasks.
* Streamlit Application: Deployed for simple user interaction and visualization.
* Model Performance: Evaluated using key metrics to ensure robustness and accuracy.
  
# Technologies Used
* Python
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning: ANN, CNN
* Streamlit for deploying the web application
  
# Setup Instructions

1) Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dance-forms-classification.git
    
2) Navigate into the project directory:
   
    cd dance-forms-classification
   
3) Install the required libraries:
   
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow streamlit scikit-learn
   
4) Run the Streamlit app:
   
    streamlit run app.py
   
# Usage

Once the app is running, upload an image of an Indian dance form, and the model will classify and predict the type of dance form.
